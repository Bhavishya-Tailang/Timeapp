<!-- Create a timesheet application for employees, each employee should have a reporting manager. The employees should be able to fill the timesheet. Once the timesheet is filled up, the manager should be able to rate the employee on a scale of 1 to 5. Once the employee has been rated for a particular day, he would not be able to make any changes to the timesheet.
